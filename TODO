- need to ensure svg before and after (we didn't break it): for "normal" Linux binaries
  --> comparing the svg visually, or generate a diff and compare that
- question of upstreaming: removed jsoo support
  -> containers (+ seq)
- question: how to preserve file information for C code (mirage-crypto / gmp / ...)?
  --> question about passing C compiler flags somewhere / somehow
  --> works for freelist.c
- integration into builder-web
  - also output the ELF binary size, and the sections we're displaying in the treemap
    --> text & data sections, no debug sections (symbol table, ...)
    -> allow us to investigate the section-size - treemap-bytes = ???
- source locations of modules (take the one from code_begin)
